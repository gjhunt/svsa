# Support Vector Spectrum Approximator

The Support Vector Spectrum Approximator (SVSA) is a python package for creating quick and accurate approximations of any spectral lineshapes model.

The python package is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/svsa/).

A basic vignette of how to use SVSA to approximate the Tenti S6 lineshape model is available in as an [ipython notebook](examples/fitting_example.ipynb). Once fit in python you can export the fit for use in any other language. Examples can be found for how to do this for [Matlab](examples/test_pred.m) and [the R language](examples/test_pred.R).
